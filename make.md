1. Fill a 5 gallon bucket with about 41⁄2 gallons of rain water, pond water or well water. If you use chlorinated ‘city’ water, it should set in the container for 24 hours or more, to allow the chlorine to escape.
2. We add 1 gallon of fresh worm castings (about 5:1, water to castings), and stir.
3. Allow the worm tea to set for 24 hours, stirring a few of times, this adds oxygen.
4. Strain the worm tea through a filter (we use an old T-shirt). You may need to do this a couple of times if you’re going to use in a sprayer. If using as a fertilizer, we just pour around the plants without straining. If desired you can dilute to a light ‘tea’ color.
5. We try to make only what we will use, but any left overs can be stored, out of sunlight, in an open container. Probably for up to about a week or so. Or we just dump the left overs around our plants for a fertility boost. Now that you see how easy it is, you can make up a batch whenever you want.

There are many benefits to using worm tea.

- It can be used as a natural insect repellent (it can repel mites, white flies, aphids, and others).
- It can also serve as an organic fungicide when you apply it to your garden soil, or on plant surfaces.
- It is an organic soil additive that will not burn plants, it enhances the composition of the soil and helps improve the soil’s moisture retention capabilities.
- It’s cost-effective and it’s environmentally friendly. We always use our worm tea that day.
