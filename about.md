I grew up here in [Jacksonville][def3], right across the street from where we are now. My mom, my 3 sisters and I, grew a garden every summer. We grew tomatoes, bell peppers, greens, summer squash, okra, green beans and I think black-eyed peas, in long raised rows. We watered pretty much daily, occasionally side dressing the rows, dusting for bugs & worms and constantly pulling weeds.

At 18, I joined the US Air Force, during the 8 years I was in, I moved 6 times. In Mississippi, Upstate New York, South Carolina and North Carolina, I had a garden. Other than pulling a few weeds occasionally, the gardens flourished. After several years in North Carolina, I moved back home to Jacksonville.

That was more than 20 years ago, and over all those years I tried gardening several times, probably spending several thousand dollars, with little to no success. I gave up.

Then I met what we call now an urban farmer, he knew and explained what I had been doing wrong. He said that if I wanted a garden to feed me, I had to ‘feed the soil’.  He showed me his secret that he shared with anyone who would listen. He grew worms, added the worm castings to his soil and made worm tea, to spray his plants.

That’s when I started raising worms. I’ve started gardening again. I am starting small, 3 raised beds and some large tubs. I planted some fruit trees and blueberries. I ‘brewed’ some worm tea and sprayed for bugs. I used worm castings mixed in the soil. I grew some beautiful carrots and [Kohlrabi][def] for the first time here in Florida, (so far) no bugs. I grew radishes, using the tops mainly for the chickens. I started some seed trays with tomatoes and peppers, we will see, sprouted and so far so good. It’s exciting to me because it seems to be working.

My hope is that you will join me and try growing some of your own food. We live in a time, with information at our fingertips. Go online, learn about the ‘worm revolution’, these amazing creatures can turn our food, waste and landfill problems around. My plan is to work towards a [‘John Jeavons’ garden][def2], adding beds until I have about 2,000 square feet in raised beds. Research this guy, buy and study his books and get growing.

May GOD Bless.
